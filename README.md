# Food Trial Application

This application is used to help those who need to trial food to see if thier body reacts to a certain food. For food trials, a person will need to be able to keep good details about the food, track how many days the trial lasted for, if the food was determined safe or not safe, if medical intervention was necessary, what type of reaction occured, what food was trialed in what amount, and be able to keep track of all trials to give to their medical team. 

Food Trial Application is a .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application using n-tier architecture. Version 1.0 

It includes:

* Data Layer: This layer houses classes that relate to the Database.
* Models Layer: This layer houses the reusable models for the rest of the layers.

* WebMVC Layer: This is where the front end (Controllers, Views, Styles, etc) will be.
