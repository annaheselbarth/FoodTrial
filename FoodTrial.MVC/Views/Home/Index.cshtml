                    The Food Trial App is an application that users can use to help assist them with food trials. Food trials are used to determine if a food is safe or not safe for a person. Often times, tests such as blood, saliva, or skin testing are inaccurate to determine an allergen or intolerance and therefore the gold standard is to do a food trial.

                    The food trial app will help to keep a record of the trial itself, create a list of food that is safe and not safe to pull from, keep track of symptoms, if medical intervention was necessary and what kind, and help the user be able to determine what food might be used in the next food trial. Having this information organized and easily accessible will help with not only their trial at home or in hospital but also help their medical team to get detailed notes on what foods are causing reactions and what type of reaction is happening in what timeframe. By having better notes and lists this will help the user stay safer and create a better all around plan for their health.
